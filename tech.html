            Building model bridges is fun. So fun that sometimes you might not even know you are learning. Physics, math, and engineering concepts are brought to life through the hands-on project of designing and building a model bridge.</p>
            <p class="desc-hide"> 
            </br>
            So, are you going to accept this CHALLENGE?</br>
            General Rules:</br>
            1)Bridge should be of the type: Suspension Bridge.</br>
            2)Participation will be in the teams of 2.</br>
            3)Material will be provided to the participants.</br>
            4)Bridges should be made from Popsicle sticks and fevicol only.</br>
            5)Adhesives expect fevicol are not allowed.</br>
            6)Only 4 supports should be added on the opposite corners.</br>
            7)A bridge that does not support itself will comply to disqualification</br>
            ROUND 1:</br>
            It is a prelim round, in which the teams are asked to pass the Quiz which is related to the Civil Engineering.</br>
            And the 5 teams are qualified to the next round and they have to make the bridge.</br>
            ROUND 2:</br>
            In this round the team are provided with the popsicle sticks,fevicol and clips </br></br></br>

            Judging Criteria:</br>
            1)Self weight of the bridge (The minimum, the better).</br>
            2)Load will be added on the centre of the bridge till it collapses. If the bridge does not collapse till the maximum weight, the deflection will be measured.</br>
            3)Aesthetics.</br>
            4)Marks will be deducted if there is increase or decrease in length 5mm or onwards.</br>
            5)Marks will be deducted  if number of sticks used will be increase from 250 </br></br>

            Here's a 3 pointer for all-you-need-to-know about AutoCAD!</br>
            CAD stands for Computer Aided Design.</br>
            This software is used extensively by Civil, Mechanical and Architectural professionals, all across the globe.</br>
            Its main function is to draft any 3D structure in 2D or 3D schematic representation, with the exact dimensions, so as to show detailed information of every teeny-tiny curve of the structure.</br>
            </p>
            <p class="desc-hide"></br>
            General Rules:</br>
            Anyone wishing to participate must bring his/her own laptop. Software used will be AutoCAD 2014 and the setup will be provided by the organizers, 1 hour prior to the competition. Please bring your own Pen drives if you are going to need the setup.</br>
            The participants should check their system compatibility with the software. The organizers will not be responsible for any improper functioning of the software.</br>
            The event will consist of 2 rounds. </br>
            ROUND 1:</br>
            A prelim round, which would only be conducted if the no. of participants exceed our estimated batch.</br>
            For this, a simple 2D drawing would be given and some time would be allotted. Participants who finish the drawing within the allotted time period (i.e. 15 mins.) will proceed to the next round.</br>
            ROUND 2 :</br>
            The Final Round, for which, participants would be given a 3D plan. Time period for this round would be 45 minutes to 1 hour.</br>
            Since we have limited number of charging points, so first-come-first-serve basis would come into play!</br>
